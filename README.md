# StormDesk

StormDesk, a fully functional drainage modelling software based on EPASWMM, covers the whole process of 1D Hydrologic and Hydraulic modelling process. In addition, a lot of extra efforts have also been made after adopting the experience of many front-line engineers, to improve user interface and enhance toolboxes, which allow users to focus on the engineering.

As a sister product of [WaterDesk](https://github.com/WaterDesk/WaterDesk-WS), StormDesk is <b>FREE</b> too!
